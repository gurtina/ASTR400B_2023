    "The orbital period decays from ~110 to 90 over 1.5 Gyr then from 90 to 75 over 1.2 Gyr \n",
    "if this rate of decay were to continue, you would expect it to take 75 /[(110-90)/1.5] ~ 5.6 Gyr for the orbit of M33 to decay from 75 kpc. \n",
    "\n",
    "BUT the rate of decay is slowing down by the end of the simulation - rate of (75-70)kpc/1 Gyr ~ 4 kpc/Gyr. At that rate it would take more than 20 Gyr to merge!   Galaxies merge because their orbits decay owing to dynamical friction. This friction term scales with the mass of the galaxy. As M33's mass is removed by tidal effects, the strength of dynamical friction weakens and the decay rate of the orbit slows.  It will take a very long time for the M33 remnant to merge! This is much longer than for the much more massive MW and M31 to merge! \n",
    "\n",
    "This fits well with the expectations if you fit an exponential decay rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: If you don't decrease RMAX by 4 for M33 the Orbit will look pretty ratty because there is a lot of tidal debris\n",
    "Another, more clever way, would be to use a smaller volume centered on the COM from the previous snapshot as the starting point. "
